# Welcome to Workshop 3: Building Classification Models with OpenVINO!

In this workshop, we will be covering the basics of image classification, its applications, and the challenges involved in building a successful image classification model. We will then move on to building a simple image classification model using a pre-trained model, followed by converting the model to the OpenVINO format and optimizing it for different hardware architectures. Finally, we will deploy the optimized model and measure its performance.

By the end of this workshop, you will have a better understanding of image classification, pre-trained models, and the process of optimizing and deploying models using OpenVINO. You will also have hands-on experience building and deploying your own image classification model.

## Topics covered
- Introduction to image classification and its applications
- Building a simple image classification model using a pre-trained model
- Converting the model to the OpenVINO format and optimizing it for different hardware architectures
- Deploying the optimized model and measuring its performance

# Workshop 1: Introduction to Deep Learning and OpenVINO

Welcome to the first workshop in our series on machine learning with OpenVINO! This workshop is designed to provide an introduction to Python, deep learning and OpenVINO, with a focus on understanding the different types of tasks that deep learning can be used for and how OpenVINO can help optimize models for different hardware architectures. By the end of this workshop, you should have a good understanding of what deep learning is, how it can be used in product development, and what types of tasks it can be used for. You'll also learn about OpenVINO, a toolkit that can help you optimize your deep learning models for different hardware platforms. We'll provide a combination of lectures, demos, and hands-on exercises to help you get up to speed with both deep learning and OpenVINO, so you'll be ready to tackle more advanced topics in the following workshops.

# Overview of this session:

- Introduction to deep learning and its applications.
- Why Python is a popular language for machine learning and deep learning, and an overview of popular libraries and frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.
- Overview of Docker and its advantages for development environments.
- Explaining the different types of tasks that deep learning can be used for (classification, detection, segmentation, etc.).
- An overview of OpenVINO and how it can help optimize deep learning models for different hardware architectures.

# Why Python?

Python is one of the most popular programming languages for machine learning and deep learning, due to its simplicity, ease of use, and large community of developers. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks specifically designed for machine learning, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV. These libraries provide pre-built functionality for tasks like data preprocessing, model building, and training, making it easier for developers to get up and running with machine learning quickly and easily.

# Using a Docker image
Docker is a platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone executable packages that include everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

In this workshop, we will provide a Docker image that includes Python and the necessary libraries and frameworks for deep learning. This will allow you to quickly get up and running with the development environment without needing to worry about installing and configuring software locally on your machine. We'll provide instructions on how to use the Docker image during the workshop.

# Overview of OpenVINO
OpenVINO is a toolkit from Intel that allows developers to optimize deep learning models for different hardware architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and VPUs. It includes pre-trained models, conversion tools, and optimization techniques that can help developers create efficient and high-performance deep learning applications.

During the workshop, we'll provide an overview of OpenVINO and explain how it can be used to optimize deep learning models for different hardware architectures. We'll also demonstrate how to use OpenVINO to deploy a model on a hardware device.
